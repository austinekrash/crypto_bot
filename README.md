In this project, i will try to use the Kraken API (or an existing DataBase of cryptocurrency daily data)  to program a trading bot using simple rules of support/resistance, volume, EMAs, and strategies such as MACD.

The first objective of this project is to back test the strategy with existing data to optimize the code.
the second objective is to throw the bot in the wild and trade autonomously.

Wish me luck!

I successfully coded a request python script to get daily Bitcoin data since 2013 (source: coinmarketcap.com) created an excel file to store the date as well as a candlestick chart with the MACD indicator for data vizualization.

I included a backtest section to see if our specific strategy was profital with a starting investment of 100 USD.

I diplayed the results in a Dataframe.

The next objective is to manipulate our trading rules for optimizing the results we already had.
Then, we will include other strategies such as the RSI (Relative Strengh Index) to compare them with each other and select the most profitable strategy for our trading bot to adopt.

Wish me luck!
