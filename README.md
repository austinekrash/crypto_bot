In this project, i will try to use the Kraken API (or an existing DataBase of cryptocurrency daily data)  to program a trading bot using simple rules of support/resistance, volume, EMAs, and strategies such as MACD.

The first objective of this project is to back test the strategy with existing data to optimize the code.
the second objective is to throw the bot in the wild and trade autonomously.

wich me luck!
